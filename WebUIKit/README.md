WebUIKit
========
WebUIKit is a simple web widgets and controls collection to be used with ohttpd.

If you say ohttpd is a clone of Microsoft速's IIS速 using Objective-C, WebUIKit is its ASP.net速 counterpart. Meanwhile, thanks to the dynamic nature of Objective which gave birth to the wonderful features of Interface Builder速, WebUIKit pages (whose extension .wib stands for Web Interface Builder) are dynamically binded as well.
