CGIStream
=========

CGIStream is a clone of `System.IO.StreamReader` and `System.IO.StreamWriter` based on existing NSStream infrastructure. It also replaces the existing CGILineReader private class in CGIKit.

This library is actually not part of CGIKit per s√©, but since built with CGIKit, it also used CGIKit class prefixes.
